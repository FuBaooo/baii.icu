## About me

I am FuBaooo, a full-time front-end developer with a little knowledge of back-end [node.js](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn) & [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

I hope to become a developer not only at the front end, but also keep up with the trend. I did some small projects and read a lot of documents. They are also trying to learn new things. If you are interested in what I have done, please join us.

Here are my [all projects](/projects). I also learned that the mogul has opened [some challenges](/challenges) to enable me to learn, strengthen and improve the knowledge I have learned.

In [here](/blogs), I will also record some problems encountered or things learned.

Hope have a chance to make a fortune. I will record some things here in the future.
